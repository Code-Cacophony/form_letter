        <p>So far, the only way we've been able to capture user input is by using confirm() and prompt(). Let's learn about forms so that we can build more interesting pages.
          Have you ever played Mad Libs? You're prompted to fill out a list of nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., and then copy them onto another piece of paper that contains a story, missing those crucial words that you are now providing. The idea is to pick bizarre words without knowing what the story is, and then when you fill them in, the results can be hilarious.</p>
